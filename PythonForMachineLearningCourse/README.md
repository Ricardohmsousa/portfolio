# Python for data science course

These are some assets on the python for data science course. It includes libraries as pandas, keras, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn , sklearn etc.

It also includes a small Spark course at the end.

The first folder has the notebooks provided with the classes. The second folder is my solution to the exercices.
